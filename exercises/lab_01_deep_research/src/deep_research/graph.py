# --- Exercise 4: Define the Graph ---
# Goal: Wire the nodes together into a runnable graph.

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from deep_research.state import ResearchState
from deep_research.nodes import planner_node, searcher_node, synthesizer_node


# 1. Initialize the Graph with our State
# workflow = StateGraph(ResearchState)

# 2. Add Nodes
# workflow.add_node("planner", planner_node)
# ...

# 3. Add Edges
# ...

# 4. Compile the Graph
# app = workflow.compile()

# Placeholder for the exercise
